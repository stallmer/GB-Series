This is a collection of m3u8 playlist files containing youtube or archive.org links.

The intention is to use these with mpv and yt-dlp. If you have mpv setup to save your position on exiting, you can load the m3u8 file and pick up right where you left off.

**Requirements**
- mpv
- yt-dlp

I also like to have `save-position-on-quit` in my `mpv.conf` file so that the playlist will continue from where I left off the last time I was watching.
